This is a very simple illustration how to type math formula: $$y=\beta_1+\beta_2 x+\varepsilon$$

```markdown
$$y=\beta_1+\beta_2 x+\varepsilon$$
```



Certainly! Markdown (`.md`) files are widely used on GitHub for documentation, instructions, and other textual content due to their simplicity and versatility. Here's a brief introduction to the most essential elements you should know for writing Markdown files on GitHub:

### Headers

Headers are created by placing a hash sign (`#`) before your header text. The number of hash signs indicates the level of the header:

```markdown
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
```

### Emphasis

- **Bold**: To bold text, wrap it in two asterisks or underscores. For example, `**bold text**` or `__bold text__`.
- *Italic*: To italicize text, wrap it in one asterisk or underscore. For example, `*italic text*` or `_italic text_`.

### Lists

- **Unordered Lists**: Use asterisks, plus signs, or minus signs as bullets.
  ```markdown
  - Item 1
  - Item 2
    - Subitem 2.1
    - Subitem 2.2
  ```
- **Ordered Lists**: Use numbers followed by periods.
  ```markdown
  1. First item
  2. Second item
     1. Subitem 2.1
     2. Subitem 2.2
  ```

### Links

To create a link, wrap the link text in brackets (`[ ]`), and then wrap the URL in parentheses (`( )`). For example: `[GitHub](https://github.com)`.

### Images

To add an image, it's similar to links but starts with an exclamation mark (`!`), followed by the alt text in brackets, and the image URL in parentheses. For example: `![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)`. You can also use a URL for images hosted online.

### Code

- **Inline Code**: To denote inline code, wrap the text in backticks (\`). For example, `` `var example = true;` ``.
- **Code Blocks**: For larger snippets, wrap the code in triple backticks (```) and specify the language for syntax highlighting (optional).
  \```javascript
  function test() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
  }
  \```

### Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, start a line with a greater than sign (`>`). For nested blockquotes, use multiple greater than signs. For example:

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
>> This is a nested blockquote.
```

### Horizontal Rules

To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (`***`), dashes (`---`), or underscores (`___`) on a line by themselves.

### Tables

Tables are created using dashes (`-`) for the header separator and pipes (`|`) for columns. Align text with colons.

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|:--------:|---------:|
| Default  | Center   | Right    |
| Text     | Text     | Text     |
```

### Task Lists

To create task lists, use dashes followed by brackets. If the task is completed, place an `x` in the brackets.

```markdown
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task
```

### GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)

GitHub supports its own version of Markdown called GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM), which adds some additional features like emoji support (`:emoji:`), mention of users and teams (`@user`), and more.

This introduction covers the basics, but there's much more to Markdown. Practice and exploring documentation can help you master it. GitHub's own guides and the Markdown specification are great resources for deeper learning.
